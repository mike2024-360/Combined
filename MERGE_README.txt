MERGED ADMIN + LOVABLE BACKEND
==============================

What I did:
- Extracted your original admin dashboard files from The Admin.zip into admin_original/
- Scanned the Lovable export (code-parcel-main (1).zip) for backend-like files (SQL, supabase, server, edge functions, package.json)
- Copied identified backend files into backend_from_lovable/
- Scrubbed any obvious secrets (API keys, supabase keys, JWTs) and replaced with 'REPLACE_ME_SECRET' or 'REPLACE_ME_JWT' placeholders.
- Created this merged package so you can directly upload the backend files to Supabase and keep your admin HTML as-is.

Where to look now (in the merged folder):
- admin_original/   -> your original admin HTML files (index.html, parcel.html, report.html, settings.html, user.html)
- backend_from_lovable/ -> backend files pulled from the Lovable export (SQL, edge function examples, server files).

Important manual steps you must do next (vibe-coder simple):
1) Inspect backend_from_lovable/create_tables.sql (or similar) and run it in Supabase SQL editor to create tables and RLS policies.
2) Open backend_from_lovable/supabase-init.js (if present) and replace placeholders with your SUPABASE_URL and SUPABASE_ANON_KEY.
3) If there are edge functions in backend_from_lovable/, deploy them using Supabase CLI or your preferred provider. Set env vars (SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE, PAYSTACK_SECRET, etc) in the server environment â€” DO NOT put service_role in client code.
4) In admin_original/ files, import the supabase client if not already done: e.g. add `import { supabase } from '../backend_from_lovable/supabase-init.js'` (adjust path as needed).
5) Test locally: run a static server (python -m http.server) and open your admin pages. Test creating parcels and adding locations. Then run the public tracking page and ensure it reads data from Supabase.
6) If any keys were scrubbed, replace `REPLACE_ME_SECRET` in backend files with the real secrets **on the server only**.
7) Commit the merged project to your GitHub repo and let Cursor or Copilot make improvements (mobile responsiveness, UI tweaks).

Notes on secrets redaction (very important):
- I replaced likely secrets with placeholders. Check backend_from_lovable/ files for strings 'REPLACE_ME_SECRET' and 'REPLACE_ME_JWT' and replace them with real values in server-side environment variables, not in frontend files.

If you want, I can now create a single zip of admin_original + backend_from_lovable so you can download it and push to GitHub, or I can attempt to inject the supabase-init import into your admin files for you. Which do you want?
